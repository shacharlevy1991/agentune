class DuckdbManager:
    """Manages duckdb databases and connections, and relatedly, the size and creation of the duckbd threadpool(s).

    This class is NOT thread-safe while you're attaching or detaching databases.
    Afterwards, connection instances you acquire from the cursor() method are also not thread-safe,
    and every thread needs to acquire its own connection. You may also wish to create cursors
    to separate connection-level effects like transactions and USE statements.

    Each instance of this class starts out by connecting to one database and can attach more databases later.
    A single threadpool is used, no matter how many databases are attached.
    Attaching and detaching databases affects all connection instances previously returned by cursor().
        
    The default database (out of those attached) is always the first one; you can execute USE on a connection
    to change it locally, but this doesn't affect other connections.
    (This limitation is required because otherwise all code calling connection.cursor() would have to re-apply
    the USE statement, and most code calls connection.cursor() and not the cursor() method of this class because
    it doesn't have a reference to this class.)

    The class instance always keeps an open connection instance, so closing all connections outside of this class
    will not free any resources until this class's own .close() is called.
    Code SHOULD scope the use of connection instances obtained from this class, so that resources are freed
    when this class is eventually closed.
    
    There is currently no way to force close a database instance (discard an in-memory database, release files, close threads) 
    while live (python) connections remain. We can implement this in the future by using lower-level duckdb APIs.

    The main database (passed to the constructor) is always attached under the default name given to it by duckdb.
    This is the file basename for on-disk databases, and 'memory' for in-memory databases.
    This is a duckdb limitation. Databases attached later can use arbitrary names.

    The following database names are reserved and may NOT be used for either the primary database or later attached ones:

    - 'system', 'temp': reserved by duckdb
    - 'memory': this is (unchangeable) name used by the primary database, if it's in-memory. To avoid confusion,
                it cannot be used for on-disk databases, or for secondary databases attached later (even if they're in-memory).

    The following schema names are reserved:

    - 'main': the default schema created with every database; code should not try to delete it or (re)create it
    - 'information_schema', 'pg_catalog': reserved by duckdb
    - 'agentune_temp': used by this library for temporary tables and views. This schema is created (empty) when this class
                       connects to a primary database (unless in read-only mode). It is dropped on exit. It is also dropped
                       with all its contents if we discover it exists on start-up (left over from a previous run).
                       This schema is not created in databases attached later.

                       Code should use `DuckdbManager.temp_schema_name`, not the literal name.
